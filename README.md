## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a javascript web developer based in the south of France (Mougins in the Alpes-Maritimes departement) and I'm currentely looking for a job in "alternance" in PHP for 24 months for the OpenClassRooms specialization course "Developpeur d'application PHP / Symphony". 

I already had some experience in PHP.

Thanks!
